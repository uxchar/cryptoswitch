# CryptoSwitch

CryptoSwitch is a simple app for those interested in cryptocurrency values in relation to the US Dollar. Currently, there are a totalof 5 popular cryptocurrency choices to choose from such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Binance. The crypto value information is pulled from the CoinMarketCap API. I used the free version which somewhat limited some of the information I could pull and how instant the information would be. 



## Requirements



## Features

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program (**App can continue to do numerous conversions until user types "N" at the end of the last conversion**)

Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application(**JSON file is pulled and data is extracted from the CMC API.**)

Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app (**App is connected to the CMC API for up-to-date data on cryptocurrency values.**)

Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams) (**App converts from USD to cryptocurrency or vice versa.**)
