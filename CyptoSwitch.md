# CryptoSwitch

CryptoSwitch is a simple app for those interested in cryptocurrency values in relation to the US Dollar. Currently, there are a totalof 5 popular cryptocurrency choices to choose from such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Binance. The crypto value information is pulled from the CoinMarketCap API. I used the free version which somewhat limited some of the information I could pull and how instant the information would be.
